The objective of this project was to implement a set of sensors, ideally placed in each room of a house, which manage and monitor the temperature using Contiki and simulating it in Cooja.\\
The requirements are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item turn on/off the air conditioning, the heating and the ventilation unit;
	\item capture, store and visualize the temperature of each room;
	\item send an alert when the average temperature is above/below a certain
threshold.   
\end{itemize}
